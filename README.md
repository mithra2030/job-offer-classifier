## üìå Project Summary

This web app helps classify job offer emails as **Real** or **Fake** using two techniques:

1. **Email Domain Matching**: Extracts the domain from the sender‚Äôs email (e.g., `@amazon.com`) and checks its presence in the email content.
2. **Machine Learning Fallback**: If domain matching fails, the app uses a trained machine learning model to analyze email content and predict whether it‚Äôs genuine or suspicious.
